<p>Recently, I stumbled across a fantastic open-source project called Pwnagotchi.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, it’s a playful nod to Tamagotchis—but with a cybersecurity twist. Instead of feeding a digital pet, you’re training a small device to passively observe and learn from Wi-Fi environments.</p>

<p>As someone with a background in cybersecurity and a growing interest in electronics, this felt like the perfect project to take on.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-pwnagotchi">What Is a Pwnagotchi?</h2>

<p>A Pwnagotchi is a DIY, battery-powered device built around a Raspberry Pi. It uses bettercap under the hood to monitor Wi-Fi traffic and capture handshakes, all while displaying a charming “face” that evolves based on its activity.</p>

<p>The project is surprisingly beginner-friendly. With some basic Linux and Raspberry Pi knowledge, you can get one up and running without soldering or advanced electronics experience.</p>

<h2 id="hardware-selection">Hardware Selection</h2>

<p>After some research, I settled on a portable configuration featuring an e-ink display and internal battery. This keeps power consumption low and gives the device a very authentic Tamagotchi-like feel.</p>

<h3 id="parts-list">Parts List</h3>

<p>Here’s the hardware I used for my build:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (with header pins)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Waveshare v4 2.13” E-Ink Display HAT</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PiSugar 3 (1200mAh) Battery</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>32GB MicroSD Card (plus USB adapter or card reader)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Micro-USB to USB-A Cable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3D-Printed Case</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The case isn’t strictly necessary, but since I already own an FDM 3D printer, it was an easy decision.</p>

    <figcaption>Pwnagotchi Parts</figcaption> 
</figure>
<h2 id="assembly">Assembly</h2>

<p>One of the biggest advantages of this build is that it’s completely solderless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Waveshare e-ink display slots directly onto the Raspberry Pi header pins.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The PiSugar battery mounts to the back of the Pi using four screws.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

    </div> 
    <figcaption>Pwnagotchi Build</figcaption> 
</figure>

<p>The entire assembly process took only a few minutes.</p>

<h2 id="software-installation">Software Installation</h2>

<p>Rather than repeating everything in the documentation here, I’ll link the guide I followed:</p>

<p><a href="https://pwnagotchi.org/getting-started/index.html">Getting Started Guide</a></p>

<p><a href="https://pwnagotchi.ai/">Official Pwnagotchi Website</a></p>

<p>Installation involves flashing a custom Pwnagotchi image to the microSD card using Raspberry Pi Imager, inserting it into the device, and connecting the Pi to your computer via USB.</p>

<h2 id="initial-setup-windows">Initial Setup (Windows)</h2>

<p>I completed the setup on a Windows laptop:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Installed the RNDIS driver so Windows could recognize the Pwnagotchi as a USB Ethernet device.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assigned a static IP address as recommended in the guide.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Connected via SSH and immediately changed the default password (highly recommended).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Initial configuration is handled via an interactive wizard:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo pwnagotchi --wizard
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once complete, the device is technically ready—b
Below are the key settings I recommend enabling or modifying:</p>

<p>ut a few important security and usability settings should be configured first.</p>

<h2 id="web-ui-and-configuration">Web UI and Configuration</h2>

<p>The main configuration file lives at:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While this can be edited manually, the web UI provides a much more user-friendly experience.</p>

<h3 id="enabling-the-web-ui">Enabling the Web UI</h3>

<p>With the device connected to your PC, navigate to:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>http://10.0.0.2:8080
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once inside the web UI:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Go to Plugins</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enable the webcfg plugin</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>From here, all configuration can be handled through the browser.</p>

<p>Disabling deauthentication is especially important to avoid disrupting nearby networks and potential legal issues.</p>

<h2 id="securing-bettercap">Securing Bettercap</h2>

<p>Pwnagotchi relies on bettercap for packet capture and analysis. bettercap has its own web interface, accessible at:</p>

<h2 id="testing-the-device">Testing the Device</h2>

<p>After rebooting, I unplugged the device and tested it on my home network. The Pwnagotchi successfully captured a handshake, which was clearly indicated on the display.</p>

<p>Handshake files can be found at:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/home/pi/handshakes

<p>To my delight I stumbled across a fantastic open source project called Pwnagotchi, a nod to Tamagotchis but with a focus on cybersecurity and hacking.
This cute little device is a DIY build with multiple options for the components, though generally the brains of the operation are handled by a raspberry pi.
After some research I settled on a battery powered version with a 2.13inch E-Ink Display (like Amazon Kindles Screen) powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.</p>

<p>As I have recently taken an interest in building electronics paired with my knowledge of cyber security this was the perfect project for me to undertake.
Thankfully, the Pwnagotchi build is very beginner friendly, only some basic linux and raspberry pi knowledge is required to get it up and running.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the parts I used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with Header Pins</li>
  <li>Waveshare v4 2.13inch E-Ink Display Hat</li>
  <li>PiSugar 3 1200mAh Battery</li>
  <li>32GB MicroSD Card (and a USB adaptor or card reader to connect it to your PC)</li>
  <li>Micro USB to USB-A cable</li>
  <li><a href="https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/coque-pwnagotchi-waveshare3-pisugar3-et-protection-d-ecran-plexiglass">3D Case I Printed</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The case is not entirely necessary but as I already own a FDM 3D printer it was a no-brainer.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/pwnagotchi/parts.jfif" alt="Pwnagotchi Parts" width="600" />
  <figcaption>Pwnagotchi Parts</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Instead of going over the installation steps, I will provide the guide I used for anyone that would like to tackle this project themselves: <a href="https://pwnagotchi.org/getting-started/index.html">Guide I Used</a></p>

<p>There is also some good information here as well:
<a href="https://pwnagotchi.ai/">Pwnagotchi Website</a></p>

<p>The build process was actually quite straightforward, and being a solderless build is a bonus for anyone yet to venture into soldering.</p>

<p>The Waveshare screen clicks into the pins on the raspberry pi and the PiSugar battery connects via the back of the raspberry pi using 4 mounting screws.</p>

  </div>
  <figcaption>Pwnagotchi Build</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After putting the device together I proceeded with the installation of the Pwnagotchi software. This is done by flashing a custom image from the <a href="https://pwnagotchi.org/getting-started/index.html">guide</a> to the micro sd card via the Raspberry Pi Imager software.</p>

<p>After the imaging process, it was time to insert the sdcard into our newly build Pwnagotchi and connect it to the computer.</p>

<p>The guide is thorough enough to show the process for Windows, Linux and MacOS but since I already had my Windows laptop in front of me as I followed the guide, I decided to continue the process with it.</p>

<p>To get the Pwnagotchi to be recognised as a USB Ethernet device in Windows I was required to install the RNDIS driver, the setup was simple and the PC detected the pwnagotchi as a network device.</p>

<p>I assigned a static IP to the ethernet device as per the <a href="https://pwnagotchi.org/getting-started/index.html">guide</a> so it would be easy to ssh into and access the web gui.</p>

<p>I recommend changing the SSH password as the first thing you do after logging into it. From a security standpoint, using a default password to login to any device is always a big no.</p>

<p>Configuring the device was simple using the provided wizard which can be accessed using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo pwnagotchi --wizard</code></p>

<p>After going through the prompts and completing the configuration your Pwnagotchi is technically ready to start capturing wifi handshakes but there are still some important configurations I would setup first.</p>

<p>Now, you can edit the configuration file manually, it is located on the device at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml</code> but there is a simpler more user friendly way to edit this config with the web gui.</p>

<p>You can access the web gui of the pwnagotchi by having it connected to the PC and navigating in a browser to the IP address on port 8080. for eg. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://10.0.0.2:8080</code>. (If this doesn’t work, continue reading the recommended settings in the next section.)
If successful, you will see your cute little Pwnagotchi face inside your web browser now. Next, I clicked on Plugins and enabled the webcfg plugin.
Now I can edit all the settings via the web gui instead of needing to ssh into the device each time I want to make a change.</p>

<p>Here is a list of option I recommend setting:</p>
<div class="language-toml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Opt Out of PwnGrid reporting (Opt Out of sharing data publicly, used for leaderboards etc)</span>

<span class="c"># Changing the web gui password (and enabling the web gui if it hasn't been enabled already)</span>
<span class="n">ui</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">web</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">enabled</span> <span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span>
<span class="n">ui</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">web</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">auth</span> <span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pwangotchi runs bettercap under the hood to handle packet capturing. bettercap in itself is a very powerful and capable piece of software which can be accessed via a web gui just like the pwnagotchi screen can. Try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwnagotchi.local</code> in your web browser (replace pwnagotchi with the name you gave your device) to access bettercap. (The default credentials are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwnagotchi</code> for the username and password.)</p>

<p>I recommend changing the bettercap password from the default as well, this is a little trickier to change but I will explain the steps I took:</p>

<ol>
  <li>SSH into your Pwnagotchi</li>
  <li>Go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/share/bettercap/caplets/pwnagotchi-auto.cap</code></li>
  <li>Edit these options:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>set api.rest.username "ENTER USERNAME"
set api.rest.password "ENTER PASSWORD"
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml</code></li>
  <li>Edit these options:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bettercap.username = "USERNAME"
bettercap.password = "PASSWORD"
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Restart your Pwnagotchi with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo reboot</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Now when you head to the bettercap web gui you should be able to use your new credentials.</p>

<p>Please Note: These credentials are stored in plain text so don’t use a password that would be dangerous if compromised (Like your banking password.)</p>

  <figcaption>Completed Pwnagotchi</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After the reboot, I unplugged my Pwnagotchi and tested it on my home network.
It captured the handhshake succesfully. This will be indicated on the screen, you can head <a href="https://pwnagotchi.ai/usage/">here</a> for more information on the Pwnagotchi GUI.</p>

<p>Now the Pwnagotchi merely captures wifi hanshakes, they still require more work and software to crack the password. You can access the capture files by connecting your Pwnagotchi to your PC, sshing into the device and going to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/pi/handshakes</code>
Thankfully, my wifi password was too strong to crack but alas, the Pwnagotchi has done its job.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT</p>
<ul>
  <li>Turn off Deauthentication before booting, otherwise your poor neighbours and anyone else around you will have a horrible time being kicked off their wifi networks. (Not to mention the legality issues with deauthentication packets)</li>
  <li>Change the SSH password for the device</li>
  <li>Change the Web GUI password</li>

I sat down at my desk, ready to start the day, when I received a Microsoft Teams message from our cybersecurity department. Over the weekend, a breach had occurred that impacted several users.</p>

<p>Without going into sensitive detail, the attacker had gained access to user accounts and distributed a phishing campaign via a SharePoint file.</p>

<p>My task that morning was straightforward:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assist affected users with password resets</li>
  <li>Ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) using an authenticator app was configured</li>
  <li>Restore access to their accounts</li>
</ul>

<p>After working through this process with several users, I noticed a strange pattern: <strong>none of them had received any emails since Friday</strong>.</p>

<p>At first glance, this didn’t seem alarming — it <em>was</em> the weekend — but something felt off. I sent a test email to one of the accounts. It never appeared in the inbox.</p>

<p>After searching Outlook, I discovered the message had arrived successfully, but it was sitting in the <strong>Archive</strong> folder, along with every other email received since Friday.</p>

<p>At this point, it became clear that an inbox rule was involved. However, when I checked the Outlook <em>Rules and Alerts</em> interface, <strong>no rules were visible</strong>.</p>

<p>After further research, I found multiple reports describing similar behaviour. That’s when I learned about a little-known — but highly effective — technique that allows attackers to <strong>hide Outlook/Exchange inbox rules from the Rules GUI entirely</strong>.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll walk through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How this attack works</li>
  <li>How attackers hide inbox rules</li>
  <li>How to detect hidden rules</li>
  <li>How to remove them at scale across an organisation</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="the-attack">The Attack</h2>

<h3 id="how-is-the-attack-executed">How Is the Attack Executed?</h3>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/hidden-rules/hidden-rule-attack.webp" alt="Hidden Rule Attack Steps" width="250" />
  <figcaption>Hidden Rule Attack Steps</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In our environment, external email forwarding was blocked. Instead of forwarding messages, the attacker created a rule that silently moved emails out of sight — buying time before the user realised their account had been compromised.</p>

<p>These actions are well suited to scripting and automation—particularly the creation of the malicious rule and the subsequent steps to conceal it from Outlook clients.</p>

<p>For simplicity, we’ll assume the attacker has already <strong>completed steps 1 and 2</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Obtained valid credentials</li>
  <li>Logged into the victim’s mailbox via Outlook</li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="step-3-create-a-malicious-inbox-rule">Step 3: Create a Malicious Inbox Rule</h3>

<p>The attacker creates an inbox rule that forwards or moves emails — for example, to the attackers email.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/hidden-rules/create-rule.png" alt="Creating Outlook rule" width="400" />
  <figcaption>Creating Outlook rule</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At this stage, the rule is still visible in the <strong>Rules and Alerts</strong> window.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="step-4-hide-the-rule">Step 4: Hide the Rule</h3>

<p>The next step is to make the rule nearly invisible.</p>

<p>This exploit abuses Microsoft’s <strong>Messaging API (MAPI)</strong>, a middleware layer that allows applications like Outlook to interact with mailbox data.</p>

<p>To demonstrate, I used <strong>MFCMapi</strong>, a Microsoft-provided diagnostic tool available on GitHub.</p>

<p>In this example, the rule moves emails with the subject <em>“Hidden Test”</em> to the Archive folder.</p>

  <figcaption>Rule that will be hidden</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 id="hiding-the-rule-with-mfcmapi">Hiding the Rule with MFCMapi</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Inbox in <strong>MFCMapi</strong></li>
  <li>Navigate to <strong>Folder → View → Hidden Contents</strong></li>
  <li>Locate messages with the class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IPM.Rule.Version2.Message</code></li>
  <li>Open the rule and locate the following properties:
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PR_RULE_MSG_NAME</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PR_RULE_MSG_PROVIDER</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Clear the value fields</strong> for both properties</li>
</ol>

  <figcaption>Tampering with rule properties</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Once modified, the rule no longer appears in Outlook or standard administrative interfaces.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="detecting-hidden-inbox-rules">Detecting Hidden Inbox Rules</h2>

<p>After hiding the rule, the <strong>Rules and Alerts</strong> window appears empty:</p>

  <img src="/assets/images/hidden-rules/rule-is-hidden.png" alt="No rules visible in Outlook" width="600" />
  <figcaption>No rules visible in Outlook</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>However, the rule is still active.</p>

<p>After sending a test email that meets the rule’s criteria, the message is silently moved to the Archive folder:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="detecting-hidden-rules-with-powershell">Detecting Hidden Rules with PowerShell</h2>

<p>Manually inspecting mailboxes with MFCMapi does not scale. Fortunately, <strong>PowerShell provides visibility into hidden rules</strong>.</p>

<p>First, connect to Exchange Online:</p>

<div class="language-powershell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">Connect-ExchangeOnline</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then query inbox rules, including hidden ones:</p>
<div class="language-powershell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">Get-InboxRule</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">-Mailbox</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">example</span><span class="err">@</span><span class="nx">example.com</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">-IncludeHidden</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Hidden rules appear with a numeric string.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>A compromised account cannot always be considered secure after a password reset and session token revocation alone.</p>

<p>Hidden inbox rules are a powerful persistence mechanism that can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Suppress security alerts</li>
  <li>Hide user communications</li>
  <li>Enable long-term access to information without detection</li>
</ul>

<p>Microsoft does not currently classify this behaviour as a vulnerability, as it requires authenticated access. However, it is difficult to identify any legitimate use case for completely hiding inbox rules.</p>

<p>As a result of this incident, we now:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Periodically scan for hidden inbox rules</li>
  <li>Continue to restrict external email forwarding</li>
  <li>Complete an in-depth forensic investigation into any breaches</li>
</ul>

<p>What began as a routine Monday quickly turned into a deep investigation, remediation effort, and a reminder that mailbox persistence techniques can be subtle yet highly effective.</p>

<p>Stay vigilant — and don’t rely on the Rules GUI alone.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="cybersecurity" /><category term="microsoft" /><category term="exchange" /><category term="outlook" /><category term="incident-response" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was a typical Monday morning.

It’s fast, convenient, and generally affordable. So why would anyone bother building their own server to store data and files?</p>

<p>For me, the answer came down to a few key reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Backing up and syncing across ecosystems</strong> (Apple and Google Photos in one place)</li>
  <li><strong>Data ownership and control</strong> — how secure is the platform you’re trusting?</li>
  <li><strong>Access files from any device</strong> — the biggest selling point of cloud storage</li>
  <li><strong>Learning and hands-on experience</strong> building and maintaining computers</li>
  <li><strong>Endless possibilities</strong> beyond basic storage: VMs, Home Assistant, Pi-hole, Docker, and more</li>
</ul>

<p>With those goals in mind, I decided to build my own NAS (Network Attached Storage).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="project-requirements">Project Requirements</h2>

<p>Before choosing hardware or software, I defined what I wanted this server to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plenty of storage for photo backups</li>
  <li>Store personal files accessible from any device</li>
  <li>Enough power to run virtual machines and Docker containers</li>
  <li>RAID for redundancy, plus:
    <ul>
      <li>One separate onsite backup</li>
      <li>One offsite backup over VPN</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>simple and minimal management interface</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="choosing-the-operating-system">Choosing the Operating System</h2>

<p>I narrowed my OS choices down to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unraid</li>
  <li>Proxmox</li>
  <li>TrueNAS</li>
</ul>

<p>While all three are solid options, I chose <strong>Unraid</strong>. The deciding factor was simplicity. I wanted this NAS to be easy to manage, without constantly tweaking or babysitting it. (Unraid did require a one off cost around $80 after the generous trial period.)</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Total:</strong> ~<strong>$900 AUD (excluding storage)</strong></p>

<p>The drives were donated to me instead of being thrown out due to their age — a great way to keep e-waste down and costs low.</p>

<p>Also note this image has some parts that were installed in my Personal PC, the parts from my Personal PC were then repurposed for the NAS.</p>

<h2 id="assembly-process">Assembly Process</h2>

<p>Once all the parts arrived, I removed the components from my personal PC that I planned to reuse and got started.</p>

<h3 id="case--cooling">Case &amp; Cooling</h3>

<p>The <strong>Fractal Node 804</strong> has a great layout with two separate chambers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One for components</li>
  <li>One dedicated to storage</li>
</ul>

<p>It includes three fans out of the box. I removed the drive cages initially to make assembly easier.</p>

<h3 id="initial-boot-test">Initial Boot Test</h3>

<p>Before installing the motherboard into the case, I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installed the CPU</li>
  <li>Mounted the cooler</li>
  <li>Inserted RAM</li>
  <li>Connected power on the bench</li>
</ul>

<p>It booted into the BIOS on the first try — always a good feeling.</p>

<h3 id="final-assembly">Final Assembly</h3>

<p>After installing everything into the case:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added extra spare fans for airflow (8 drives generate some extra heat)</li>
  <li>Installed all HDDs vertically in their cages</li>
  <li>Connected SATA and power cables</li>
  <li>Installed the PCIe SATA controller (the motherboard only supports 6 SATA ports)</li>
</ul>

<p>This setup leaves <strong>4 spare SATA ports</strong> for future expansion.</p>

<p>I didn’t include a dedicated GPU to keep power usage low. The Ryzen 5600G’s integrated graphics are more than sufficient for a NAS.</p>

<p>I had to replace one of the Dell drives with a 2TB Seagate I had lying around due to one of the 8 Dell drives failing on boot.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="installing-unraid">Installing Unraid</h2>

<p>Unraid runs entirely from a USB drive, which means all internal storage is available for data.</p>

<p>Installation was simple using the <strong>Unraid USB Flash Creator</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Selected server name</li>
  <li>Configured network settings</li>
  <li>Booted directly into Unraid</li>
</ul>

<p>I reserved an IP Address on my router for the NAS to ensure accessing the web GUI and file shares would be straightforward.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="storage-configuration">Storage Configuration</h2>

<p>I configured the drives using <strong>RAID 6</strong>, which provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Double distributed parity</li>
  <li>Protection against <strong>up to two drive failures</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Once the array was up and running, I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Created file shares</li>
  <li>Installed plugins for hardware monitoring (CPU temps, drive health, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Permissions were set on file shares to control access across devices and users. This allowed me to create shares that guests on the network could have access to while securing personal files with user credentials.</p>

<h2 id="virtual-machines--docker">Virtual Machines &amp; Docker</h2>

<p>Unraid makes running VMs and containers straightforward.</p>

<h3 id="what-im-running">What I’m Running</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Windows and Linux VMs</strong> (work out of the box)</li>
  <li><strong>PhotoPrism</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Central photo backup for both iPhones and Android devices</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pi-hole</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Network-wide ad blocking</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="backup-strategy-the-important-part">Backup Strategy (The Important Part)</h2>

<p>Redundancy isn’t backup — so I built a layered approach.</p>

<h3 id="onsite-backups">Onsite Backups</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Weekly Docker container backups (configurations included)</li>
  <li>Full NAS backup using <strong>Veeam</strong> on a Windows machine</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="offsite-backups">Offsite Backups</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Installed <strong>Tailscale</strong> for VPN access</li>
  <li>Connected this NAS to another NAS at a different location</li>
  <li>Used a <strong>cron job + rsync</strong> for nightly incremental backups</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>With this setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two drives can fail without data loss</li>
  <li>There’s a separate onsite backup</li>
  <li>There’s an automated offsite backup</li>
  <li>Files are accessible anywhere via Tailscale VPN</li>
  <li>Multiple ecosystems (Apple &amp; Android) sync seamlessly without subcriptions</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, this feels like a <strong>robust, flexible, and future-proof home server</strong>. It offers far more control and capability than a typical cloud storage provider — and I learned a lot in the process.</p>

<p>If you’re comfortable with hardware and want full ownership of your data, building a home server is absolutely worth considering.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>After a month of use I decided to add a 1TB ssd cache drive. This allows file transfers to be done faster via the ssd and then have the files moved from the ssd cache drive to the hdds overnight.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I added a notification setup for drive issues, backup failures etc via the Pushover app to get notifications directly to my phone if something goes wrong. This has made maintanence even easier as I don’t have to regularly check the server.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After 2 years of operation everything is still running like a dream, no drives have needed replacing and energy consumption has been around 2.2kWh per day. I have cancelled all cloud storage subscriptions now and have not looked back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Losing any data on this NAS would be detrimental therefore it is not ideal for homelab activites such as cybersecurity and networking labs. 
My next build project will be a Homelab running Proxmox to facilitate cybersecurity labs, recreating vulnerabilites, exploring the effects of malware on systems and building advanced networking configurations.</p>
