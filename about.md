# About Me

I work in ICT with a broad technical skill set spanning operating systems, programming, automation, infrastructure, networking and security. I enjoy learning through hands-on experimentation, whether that’s configuring systems, writing scripts, or working with small-scale hardware projects, always with an eye toward performance, reliability, and security.

Much of my experience comes from both professional work and practical exploration in my homelab, where I implement projects, refine workflows, and deepen my understanding of how infrastructure and networks interact. I approach technology with a mindset of continuous improvement and resilience.
